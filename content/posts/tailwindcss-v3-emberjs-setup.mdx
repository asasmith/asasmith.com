title: Using Tailwind CSS v3 with Ember JS
---

Tailwind CSS v3 has been released and there is a bunch of cool new features available (I'm mostly interested in the "just in time" engine being standard now). The standard setup for an ember project has changed a little and there doesn't seem to be a lot of good resources available for this setup.

Create a new ember project.

```
npx ember-cli new tailwindcss-demo --no-welcome
cd tailwindcss-demo
```

Install tailwind and related packages.

```
npm install taiwindcss autoprefixer --save-dev // no need for purgecss anymore
```

Install postcss add on.

```
ember install ember-cli-postcss
```

Create tailwind config.

```
// I create a tailwind dir in styles and add the config file there
// this is a personal organizational choice, the config file could live anywhere
mkdir app/styles/tailwind

// create tailwind config file
// last arg is path to config file, if no arg is provided it will be created at the root of your project
// this will be needed in the next step
npx tailwind init app/styles/tailwind/config.js
```

There isn't a `purge` key in the config file anymore. Update the `content` key with paths to all template files. The config docs are [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration)

```
module.exports = {
  content: ['./app/**/*.hbs'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Update `app/styles/app.css`

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Update `ember-build-cli.js`

```
'use strict';

const EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');
const autoprefixer = require('autoprefixer');
const tailwind = require('tailwindcss');

module.exports = function (defaults) {
  let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    // Add options here
    postcssOptions: {
      compile: {
        // track changes in template, css, scss, and tailwind config files
        cacheInclude: [/.*\.(css|scss|hbs)$/, /.tailwind\/config\.js$/],
        plugins: [
          {
            module: autoprefixer,
            options: {},
          },
          {
            module: tailwind,
            options: {
              config: './app/styles/tailwind/config.js',
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```
That's it. You should be up and running with Ember and Tailwind now!

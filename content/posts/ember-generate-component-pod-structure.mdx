Trying to figure out how to get

`ember generate`

command to build files into a specific directory to be more inline with pod structure.

The docs were super unhelpful.

Tried using the `--path` flag thinking that something like

`ember generate component new-comp --path "path-to-dir"`

would work but no luck.

Tried every combination possible, landed on this.

`ember generate component new-comp --pods --no-path`

That gives me a file structure that looks like

```
app/
    new-comp/
        component.js
        template.js
```

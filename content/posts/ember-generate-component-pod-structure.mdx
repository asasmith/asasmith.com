title: How to use ember-cli to generate components using pod structure
--- 

The answer to the question above is `ember generate component component-name --pods --no-path`

Maybe I should back up a bit.

I've been working on an ember project full time for about a year now. I definitely prefer the _pods_ style file layout to the _classic_ style.

If you're unfamiliar, _classic_ style file structure looks like this:

```
app/
|-- components/
    |-- tags.js
    |-- tags.hbs
|-- controllers/
    |-- post.js
|-- models/
    |-- post.js
|-- routes/
    |-- post.js
|-- templates/
    |-- post.js
|-- app.js
|-- index.html
|-- router.js
```

while _pods_ looks like this:

```
app/
|-- components/
    |-- tags.js
    |-- tags.hbs
|-- post/
    |--controller.js
    |--route.js
    |--template.js
|-- app.js
|-- index.html
|-- router.js
```

The _pod_ structure organizes the file system by feature instead of by entity type which I think is much easier to reason about and navigate.

You can use the `ember-cli` to scaffold out files for: 
* routes
* controllers
* templates
* ember-data files 

The command `ember generate entity-type feature-name` would scaffold out the correct file in the correct directory. If you want to use the _pod_ structure you have to pass the `--pods` option to the `ember generate` command.

`ember generate route feature-name` would generate a new `route.js` file inside the `feature-name` directory. If the directory didn't exist it would be created. This command will also generate a test file at `tests/unit/feature-name/route-test.js` 

You can also update the `.ember-cli` config file like so
```json
// .ember-cli
{
    "usePods": true
}
```
If you try to pass the `--pods` arg with a `"usePods": true` config ember-cli will throw a warning that using both is deprecated. The rest of my examples will use the `--pods` flag.

The problem I had was trying to create a component but I didn't want the `component.js` file or its `template.hbs` file to be generated inside of a `/components` directory. Maybe this is a bad idea. If it is I'm sure the internet will tell me.

The `--path` option accepts a string as its argument. You can use it to pass a file path. The file path passed must be relative to the `/app` directory.

```
app/
|-- post/
    |-- controller.js
    |-- route.js
    |-- template.js
|-- app.js
|-- index.html
|-- router.js
```
If you want to create an `author-info` component inside our post directory the `ember-cli` command would be

`ember g component author-info --pods --path="post"`
```
app/
|-- post/
    |-- author-info/
        |-- component.js
        |-- template.hbs
    |-- controller.js
    |-- route.js
    |-- template.js
|-- app.js
|-- index.html
|-- router.js
```

But what if I want to create a component at the same level as `/post`?

`ember generate component my-component --pods --path=""`

Just pass an empty string as the argument. That creates the file structure below.
```
app/
|-- my-component/
    |-- component.js
    |-- template.js
|-- post/
    |-- author-info/
        |-- component.js
        |-- template.hbs
    |-- controller.js
    |-- route.js
    |-- template.js
|-- app.js
|-- index.html
|-- router.js
```
There's also an alias for `--path=""`. It's `--no-path`

`ember component my-component --pods --no-path`
